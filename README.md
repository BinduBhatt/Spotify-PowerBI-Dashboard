# Project Title: Spotify Listening Patterns Analysis
## Introduction:
This Power BI project analyzes Spotify streaming history data (149,860 rows) sourced from Maven Analytics. The dataset was pre-cleaned, so no transformation was required. Data quality was validated using Power BI’s Column Profiling feature.

## Objective:
To analyze Spotify streaming history to uncover listening trends, artist/track preferences, and platform usage behavior through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
